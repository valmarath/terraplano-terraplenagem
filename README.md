Terraplano Terraplenagem is a project that I've made for a client who did earthwork jobs. The company eventually closed and I took the website out of its previous hosting service. But still, it was a project 100% by me, including de design and icons. It's a one page website designed and coded considering mobile first, using HTML, CSS and JS.
